# Cene_EcommercePortal
E-commerce portal (CENE), which sells a variety of different products, in a wide range of categories and a site which is user friendly and easy to navigate. The application provides a login page, with options to login, registration for new users and an admin option for the administrators. After successful login, the user is directed to the home page and category pages, where products are displayed and user can add to cart. The Shopping cart of the user enables the customer to place orders.
On the other hand, We aim to provide a platform where sellers, company owners or even local shopkeepers and small businesses can get a platform or opportunity to sell their products.The admin part of the application enables administrators, on behalf of the sellers, to add various suppliers and products as well as modify their details.
